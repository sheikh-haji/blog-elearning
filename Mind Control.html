					Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) give hope to those who are speech or motor-impaired, such as those with brain and spinal cord injuries, to gain more independence, and improve their overall quality of life. Scientists have created an artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning algorithm and brain-computer interface solution that enables patients to command a robot with their thoughts and published their study in Communications Biology.
				</p>

				<p>	“Robotic assistance via motorized robotic arm manipulators can be of valuable assistance to individuals with upper-limb motor disabilities,” the researchers wrote. “Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) offer an intuitive means to control such assistive robotic manipulators.”
					
					Unlike other brain-controlled robot studies, this study makes it easier for the patient to control the robot by increasing the authority on the autonomous robotic system. Scientists affiliated with the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the University of Texas at Austin enabled patients to train robot controllers to adapt to obstacles using the mind instead of speech or movement.</p>
					
				<p>	The research team was led by Aude Billard, an EPFL Professor and Director of the Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory (LASA), along with José del R. Millán, a professor at The University of Texas at Austin.
					
					Billard was a co-author of a 2019 EPFL study where scientists created a new type of neuroprosthetic that unifies human control with artificial intelligence automation for greater robot dexterity. Specifically, the EPFL scientists combined the scientific fields of neuroengineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence to semi-automate a part of the motor command for “shared control.” This robot arm was used to conduct the current study according to an EPFL news report.</p>
					
				<p>	The researchers used an AI-enabled brain-computer interface to measure and decode the patient’s brain activity in order to direct a robotic arm. They used inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) which is an AI machine learning framework based on observing human behavior in order to extract a reward function. This is the opposite of reinforcement learning (RL), where the AI algorithm has the goal to learn a decision-making process in order to generate behavior that will maximize a reward function. In reinforcement learning, AI agents make choices based on what it learned from sequential decisions from past experience and iterative attempts to gain the highest reward.
					
					The study participants wore a non-invasive headcap with electrodes that captured electroencephalogram (EEG) scans of brain activity. To activate the system, the patient looks at the robot, and an AI machine learning algorithm learns from patterns in the brain activity to decode what the user wants to do and what the robot needs to do to achieve it through trial and error.
					
					According to the researchers, the trial-and-error process is relatively rapid, and typically requires just three to five attempts before it learns and performs what the user is thinking. The researchers demonstrated this proof-of-concept in experiments with thirteen able-bodied users directing a robotic arm using their thoughts. The AI algorithm learned the users’ preferences and modified the robot’s actions accordingly.

			<p>Can Arduino be used to make robots?<br>
				With the Arduino Robot, you can learn about electronics, mechanics, and software. It is a tiny computer on wheels. It comes with a number of of project examples you can easily replicate, and it is a powerful robotics platform that you can hack to perform all sorts of tasks.</p>

			<h2>Mind Control</h2>
			<p><img src="images/mind_control.jfif" width="300" height="150" alt="" /></p>
			<p>DIY nerds just got some good news. Mind control is only one hack away.

				Brain-computer interface gear is now available online for purchase. It’s called OpenBCI and it will blow your mind. Why? It means makers can now incorporate brain wave control to anything they can hack. The versatile analog-to-digital converter can sample activity from the brain, muscles, and heart. The OpenBCI 8-bit board kit that’s Arduino compatible is currently available for pre-order for $399.99 at the OpenBCI store. </p>

			<p>It is very clear that EEG sensors and headsets are becoming more commercialized and thus accessible to users for building custom brain-machine interfaces with various functionalities from switching TV channels to controlling wheelchairs as in this case. We decided to take it one step further. Here we will show you how we created a Mind-Controlled Robot using Arduino which was later converted to a wheelchair.</p>
