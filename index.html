				<p>An exciting, emerging area where biology meets robotics is in brain computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs have the potential in the future to enable direct mind control of robots and other machines. This step explores the definition of a BCI and explains the key components.</p>
				<p> the past few years, BCIs have attracted a lot of attention from robotic groups, neuroscientists, computer scientists and neurologists, triggered by new scientific progress in understanding brain functions and by impressive applications. </p>
				<p>
					<strong>BCI Definition:</strong> A BCI is a device that measures electrical activity in the brain or spinal cord, and transforms it into a synthetic output that can replace, restore or enhance natural function.
				</p>
				<p>
					The BCI input is the brain signals that carry informative neural features, recorded by electrodes either in the brain or on the head. The BCI outputs are used to control a device, such as an assistive robot, a wheelchair or a prosthetic hand.
				</p>
				<strong>
					<p>
						<strong>Example:</strong> A person suffering from paralysis from the neck down would normally find independent mobility impossible. With a BCI system and a robotic wheelchair, the person can use mental imagery to imagine movement of their right hand in order to turn a wheelchair towards their right side, or their left hand to turn the chair to their left.
					</p>
				</strong>
				<p>
					The BCI uses algorithms to translate the measured brain-wave activity into command signals to control the output device, i.e. in this case, the motors driving the wheelchair to the left or right.

One of the key challenges of BCIs to solve in the future is decoding brain-wave activity into desired actions. This problem is usually addressed with machine learning algorithms, known as ‘classification’ (also known as ‘pattern recognition’). This is where a particular set of brain-wave patterns are ‘classed’ as a specific action, e.g. move left or move right.

			<p>Can Arduino be used to make robots?<br>
				With the Arduino Robot, you can learn about electronics, mechanics, and software. It is a tiny computer on wheels. It comes with a number of of project examples you can easily replicate, and it is a powerful robotics platform that you can hack to perform all sorts of tasks.</p>

			<h2>Mind Control</h2>
			<p><img src="images/mind_control.jfif" width="300" height="150" alt="" /></p>
			<p>DIY nerds just got some good news. Mind control is only one hack away.

				Brain-computer interface gear is now available online for purchase. It’s called OpenBCI and it will blow your mind. Why? It means makers can now incorporate brain wave control to anything they can hack. The versatile analog-to-digital converter can sample activity from the brain, muscles, and heart. The OpenBCI 8-bit board kit that’s Arduino compatible is currently available for pre-order for $399.99 at the OpenBCI store. </p>

			<p>It is very clear that EEG sensors and headsets are becoming more commercialized and thus accessible to users for building custom brain-machine interfaces with various functionalities from switching TV channels to controlling wheelchairs as in this case. We decided to take it one step further. Here we will show you how we created a Mind-Controlled Robot using Arduino which was later converted to a wheelchair.</p>
